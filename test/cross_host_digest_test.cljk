  "`kotoba.artifact.core/sha256` has TWO implementations -- `MessageDigest` on
  the JVM, `node:crypto` on ClojureScript -- and until 2026-09-08 only the JVM
  one was ever executed, because every test in this repository was `.clj`.

  That is the highest-risk shape this workspace has. `sha256` is the seal on an
  artifact; `content-identity` builds a CID from it. If the two hosts disagreed
  by one byte, two runtimes would compute different identities for the same
  value, and content addressing is the identity model the whole workspace rests
  on. Nothing would have said so: the JVM suite was green, and the second
  implementation was never run.

  Measured 2026-09-08, before this file existed, by computing the same six
  values under `clojure` and under `nbb` and diffing: they AGREE, byte for
  byte. So this file does not fix a defect. It pins a property that was true
  and untested, and turns `we believe these agree` into `the suite fails if
  they stop`.

  The digests below are written out in full rather than compared between hosts
  at runtime, because a test that only asserts `(= (sha256 x) (sha256 x))`
  passes on one host alone and proves nothing about the other. Each host must
  independently reproduce the same literal string."
