(ns kotoba.artifact.descriptor-table
  "The typed-value descriptor table an artifact carries, so a native loader can
  be handed a DESCRIPTOR instead of a bare integer kind.

  Why this exists. `tools/kexe_loader.c` validates a typed capability value
  against `enum kexe_typed_kind_v1` -- an integer with exactly three inhabitants
  (string, option-i64, result-i64) plus the raw i64 path. `kotoba.kir`
  independently admits exactly the matching four pairs. That is why every
  capability kit is still `:native-aot :pending`: `clock-v1`'s request is
  `[:variant :kotoba.clock/request [[:wall :bool] [:monotonic :bool]]]` and its
  result is a variant of records, and neither has an integer to be. An integer
  cannot name a field, so nothing downstream of it can either.

  What this namespace adds is the CARRIER. For the wasm target that role is
  played by the `kotoba.typed` custom section: the emitter writes a descriptor
  table into the module and the reader indexes into it. A native artifact has no
  custom section, so the sealed artifact map is the section -- same job, same
  descriptor bytes, different envelope.

  ONE encoding, not two. Every descriptor byte here comes from
  `kotoba.kir.descriptor/encode-descriptor`, the same function the wasm custom
  section calls, which is why that function was moved to T0 in the first place
  (ADR-2608049000). This namespace contributes no encoding of its own: it frames
  a count, the shared descriptor bytes, and a contract region. A second
  descriptor encoding is the specific thing being avoided, because a producer and
  a checker that only ever agree with each other can agree on the same mistake.

  Framing IS local, and deliberately so. The wasm section additionally carries a
  literal table and a schema region that a native loader has no use for, and it
  leads with an ABI version byte selected from the module's content. The rule
  being kept is that there is one encoding of a DESCRIPTOR, not that every
  carrier has the same shape. The two carriers agree where it matters: the
  descriptor table is built by the shared `descriptor-table`, so index N denotes
  the same type in a wasm custom section and in a native artifact compiled from
  the same KIR.

  Two readers make bytes a wire contract. While these bytes had exactly one
  reader they were pinned only indirectly, through whatever the wasm emitter
  happened to accept. A native loader is the second reader, so `:bytes-sha256`
  pins the encoding the producer actually used. `validate!` re-encodes and
  compares: a hand-edited artifact fails, and so does a verifier whose
  `encode-descriptor` has drifted from the producer's. That is the same drift
  detector `kotoba.artifact.runtime-identity` applies to the loader source, for
  the same reason.

  Scope. This namespace defines and validates what is carried. Emitting it from
  the compiler, and walking a value against it in the loader (new decision-free
  C), are separate landings. Nothing here qualifies any capability kit: every
  kit remains `:native-aot :pending` until a value of its shape actually crosses
  a real boundary."
